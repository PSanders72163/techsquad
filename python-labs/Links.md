Vocabularies:

Modules: textfiles containing python statements

Program: a series of procoded statements stored in a file for repeated execution

Script: top-level program file

Expressions: results are displayed automatically

functions: references to defined code. Functions allow designers to write less, and increase the manageability of code as your project grows in complexity. 

class: a class creates objects. They are a bit like object factories. Understanding how objects are initialized, then interact with functions and methods can help you make better sense of pip, import statements, dot notation, and writing more efficient code. 

method: Classes build objects. A method is just a function defined within a class. They are nothing more than functions tied to a specific class of object. Therefore, when you create an object (like a string or a list), they inherit the functions defined within their class.
